[13/20] Search for Python structured logging best practice...
Based on the analysis of the search results and the extracted content, I have created a logging configuration module that implements structured logging best practices using loguru. The module uses JSON format for structured data, includes context information in logs, uses appropriate log levels, and ensures log messages are concise and meaningful. Loguru was chosen for its simplicity, ease of use, and powerful features like automatic file rotation and rich formatting, which make it well-suited for implementing structured logging best practices in Python applications.
